<!-- ENTRY RETENTION RULE — the ticket is the durable record; this queue is the index.
  Per line, keep WHETHER/WHEN to act (gate, blocker, trigger, fork-point, date);
  cut HOW (impl recipe, paths, commands) — that lives in the ticket.
  - Ready/Active/Blocked: gate / blocker / waiting-on / fork-point + date.
  - Backlog: tag + one-line + resurrect-trigger + date. Spike findings → ticket.
  - Done: last ~10 as `id + outcome + date`; drop older (ticket + git log hold it).
  SAFETY GATE: thinning is a move, not a delete — open the ticket and confirm it
  holds the prose before you cut. If the ticket's fresher, resync the line.
  EDIT-TIME: write lines thin from the start; cap Done in the same edit that adds to it.
  All items are `1.` — rank is positional, never hand-number. Why: see commit/PR. -->
