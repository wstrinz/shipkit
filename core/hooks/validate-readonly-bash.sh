#!/bin/bash
# Ship readonly agent allow-list bash hook
# For ship-reviewer and ship-lookout subagents.
# Only allows read-only commands. Default is DENY.
#
# Design: deny-list runs first (clear error messages for common mistakes),
# then allow-list catches everything else. Default is DENY.
#
# PATTERN ANCHORING (SHIP-HOOK-PATTERN-ANCHORING): the command is split into
# segments QUOTE-AWARELY — so a reviewer's `grep -E "(activate|send_test)" f`
# is ONE grep segment, not a fragment starting at `send_test)"` that fails the
# allow-list. Deny patterns are anchored to the segment's INVOKED command when
# that command is a known data-arg binary (`grep "git push" README` passes);
# wrapper/interpreter/substitution segments keep the ORIGINAL raw substring scan.
# The allow-list is unchanged and still default-DENY.
#
# W2 (max-scrutiny review fixes): backslash-newline continuations are collapsed
# BEFORE scanning (B2); $'…' quoting forces the raw scan (N2); zero segments
# fail CLOSED (N3). No bare-interpreter whole-scan is needed here: interpreters
# are not on this allow-list, so `… | bash` already dies on default-deny
# (proven by tests).
#
# W3 (re-gate follow-ups): gh api segments now carry the mate hook's N1
# mutation deny (mutating -X/--method + implicit-POST field/body flags — this
# hook allow-lists gh api, so the deny must live here too); and a BOUNDED
# test-runner allowance (see ro_test_runner_allowed) lets reviewers execute
# repo test scripts instead of verifying by reading only.

# jq DEPENDENCY GUARD (fail CLOSED): every gate below parses the PreToolUse stdin
# with jq. Without jq the parse yields empty, the agent-type/command checks no-op,
# and the hook exits 0 — SILENT ZERO ENFORCEMENT. Refuse to run instead: exit 2
# (fail CLOSED) with a loud message. shipkit_init.py's preflight asserts jq is on
# PATH at install, so a correctly-installed ship never reaches this.

# ============================================================ SHIP-MATCH-LIB v2
# Shared segment-matching helpers. DUPLICATED into every validate-*-bash.sh hook —
# hooks must stay SELF-CONTAINED single files (installs invoke them in-place as
# `bash <abs-path>`; a missing sourced sibling would error the hook, and a non-2
# hook error FAILS OPEN). If you change this block, change it in ALL hooks
# (grep for SHIP-MATCH-LIB). bash-3.2 + POSIX-awk compatible (macOS + Git-Bash).

# Collapse backslash-newline line continuations BEFORE any scanning (W2 fix B2):
# the shell rejoins `git push origin \`⏎`main` into ONE command, so the scanner
# must too — a plain newline split let the halves dodge every pattern. REMOVAL
# (not a space) mirrors shell semantics, so mid-word smuggles (`git pu\`⏎`sh`)
# rejoin as well. Only an ODD run of backslashes continues a line; an escaped
# backslash before a newline stays a real boundary. Quote-blind on purpose:
# inside single quotes this only MERGES data into one segment (never splits),
# which can only ADD matches on the deny side — fail-closed direction.
